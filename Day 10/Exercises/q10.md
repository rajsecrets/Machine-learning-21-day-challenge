📺 **Video Tutorial: [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/u9t7JrX_xEA)**

## **Task Overview 📚**

In this task, we're diving into the exciting world of linear regression with multiple variables. No prerequisites needed – just sit back, relax, and absorb the knowledge from the fantastic video tutorial.

The dataset for this exercise can be found [here](https://github.com/rajsecrets/Machine-learning-21-day-challenge/blob/main/Day%2010/Exercises/q10.md).

## **Exercise Details 🏋️**

In the exercise folder (same level as this notebook on GitHub), discover the treasures within the `hiring.csv` file. This dataset spills the beans on a firm's hiring statistics, including experience, written test scores, and personal interview scores. Your mission: build a machine learning model to empower the HR department in setting salaries for future candidates.

## **Predict Salaries for Candidates 💰**

Using the magic of your trained model, gaze into the future and predict salaries for these candidates:

1. Candidate with 2 years of experience, a test score of 9, and an interview score of 6.
2. Candidate with 12 years of experience, a test score of 10, and an interview score of 10.

## **Important Note 🚨**

- Remember to catch the wave of knowledge by watching the video tutorial before embarking on your machine learning journey.
